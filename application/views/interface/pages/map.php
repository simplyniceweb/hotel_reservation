                <ul>
                <li> Option 1:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                        Continue along the STAR Tollway to the San Jose, Ibaan Exit 11kms. of road that narrows to a 2-lane highway just after the Lipa City Exit.
                        
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Take the San Jose/ Ibaan exit turning left to Ibaan, following the main national road you will travel through Rosario up to San Juan.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                
                <li> Option 2:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                        Leave the STAR Tollway at the Lipa City Exit 20km.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Approaching Lipa City you will see in the distance a McDonald's at a "Y" junction, veer right to the main road. To the left of the road, you'll see a Jollibee sign. Just before the sign, a cross junction, turn right on P. Torres St., One (1)km or so on your right is a Shell Gas Station, a good place to stop as facilities are clean.
                        </li>
                    <li>
                    Continue along the national road to Padre Burgos, upon reaching Padre Burgos you have two options:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                            Option 1 - go straight to Rosario clearly marked
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            Option 2 - turn left a few hundred meters to the public market then turn right at the public market and animal auction facility. Auctions are held every Friday expect a half hour or more delay, particularly in the early morning up to about 3pm. If you don't mind the delay the hustle and bustle created by animals and vendors are interesting local color. The road from Padre Garcia rejoins the national road going to San Juan. If you decide to avoid the animal auction on Friday, proceed straight to Rosario.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                        <li>
                        The road ends at a stop light controlled heavy traffic junction. There is a Jollibee on the right. Turn left towards San Juan. This junction is where the road from Ibaan joins the national road to San Juan.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Using option 1 is maybe the better choice as it avoids possible traffic in Lipa City and is a more pleasant journey overall.</p>
